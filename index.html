                    <p>Freshly squeezed fruit juice has become the basis of many diets - especially for those people who
                        do not have enough time to take care of their food, but are concerned about healthy eating</p>
                    <p>A drink extracted from fresh fruits, vegetables, berries. It is called fresh because it is
                        customary to consume this drink immediately after preparation! That is, our attention should be
                        attracted to a drink made at home or squeezed out in front of you in a catering establishment.
                        Everything else can be anything but freshly squeezed juice.</p>

                        <blockquote>"...Fresh fruit juice can contain a
                            <span class="under">variety of vitamins and nutrients</span> that benefit our health, so
                            itâ€™s not necessary to eliminate them from our diet completely, as some reports would have
                            you believe. However, fruit juice should not be a substitute for whole fruit and should be
                            consumed in moderation, as part of a balanced diet."
