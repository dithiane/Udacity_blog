                    <p>Probably, strawberries can be called one of the most attractive and appetizing berries, and it is
                        hardly possible to find a person who, having seen its juicy, ripe and bright berries, and even
                        more so, having felt their aroma, would remain completely indifferent to them. The desire to try
                        strawberries arises in us even when we see it in pictures and photographs - this beautiful,
                        juicy and healthy berry has such a pronounced, memorable taste.</p>
                    <p>Strawberry juice retains all the properties of berries, but in our country only juice is rarely
                        used at home - we are used to eating berries completely, especially since they mostly consist of
                        juice. Juice from strawberries can be harvested for future use, for the winter, and this can
                        also be done at home, but we will talk about this later.</p>
                    <p>Strawberry juice, like the berries themselves, has a rich composition. The brighter the berries,
                        the more useful and nutritious substances they contain, and the more pronounced the therapeutic
                        effect they have. Strawberry juice is still more effective than the berries themselves, and with
                        its help you can quickly recover from various diseases: of course, it should be used as an
                        addition to the main treatment, if prescribed by a doctor.</p>
